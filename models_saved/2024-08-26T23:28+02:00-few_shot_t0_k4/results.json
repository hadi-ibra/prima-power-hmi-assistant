On the other hand, the Cancel button is used to discard any changes made to the MDA program, reverting to the previous version.\n\nThe equipment status screen in Tulus displays various information related to the machine's status, including the axes status and feed rate. The axes status shows the current position and state of the machine's axes, such as X, Y, Z, and B. The feed rate, which is the speed at which the machine moves, affects the machine's operations by determining how quickly the machine executes the programmed commands.\n\nThe axes status and feed rate have a direct impact on machine operations. For example, if the axes status indicates that an axis is not in the correct position, the machine may not execute the programmed commands correctly. Similarly, if the feed rate is set too high or too low, it can affect the accuracy and quality of the machine's operations.

Adjust the delay time value as needed. The maximum value may depend on the specific TULUS configuration or the machine's capabilities.\n\nThe maximum value of the delay time is not specified in the provided context, but it's likely to be a value that is reasonable for the machine's operation.\n\nThe Delay timer control is used to set a time delay between different stages of the cutting process. This can be useful for ensuring that the machine waits for a certain period before proceeding with the next step, allowing for proper synchronization and preventing potential errors.\n\nThe Feed rate indicator shows the current feed rate of the machine, which is the speed at which the cutting head moves along the workpiece. The current setting of the feed rate indicator is not specified in the provided context, but it's likely to be a value that is set based on the specific cutting operation and the material being processed.\n\nIn the interface, the feed rate indicator may be represented by a numerical value or a graphical representation, such as a bar or a gauge. The feed rate indicator's role is to provide the operator with real-time information about the machine's cutting speed, allowing them to monitor and adjust the process as needed.", "In the TULUS Online Corrector, you can adjust the delay time by using the Delay timer control, which has a scale from 0 to 20000 ms.
