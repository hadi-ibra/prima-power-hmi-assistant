Group related items together: By creating folders and subfolders, users can group related items together, making it easier to find and access specific items.\n2. Drill down to specific items: The hierarchical structure allows users to drill down to specific items by expanding or collapsing folders and subfolders, reducing the amount of information displayed and making it easier to focus on specific items.\n3. Quickly locate specific items: The hierarchical structure enables users to quickly locate specific items by navigating through the folders and subfolders, rather than having to search through a flat list of items.\n4. Organize items in a logical manner: The hierarchical structure allows users to organize items in a logical manner, making it easier to understand the relationships between different items and to find specific items.\n\nIn the context of the Machine Parameter Editor, the hierarchical structure in the navigation pane helps users to organize and access subitems in the selected folder (e.g., PalStation1500) by grouping related parameters together (e.g., Standard, Parameters, Fluid, Tia, etc.) and allowing users to drill down to specific parameters (e.g., 13.1, 17.4, PSA 1530, etc.).", "The hierarchical structure in the navigation pane helps with organizing and accessing subitems in the selected folder by providing a clear and organized way to navigate through the different levels of folders and subitems.
