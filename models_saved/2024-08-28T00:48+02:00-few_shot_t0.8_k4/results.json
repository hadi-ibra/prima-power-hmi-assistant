However, the exact steps may vary depending on the specific cause of the alarm.\n\nAlarm ID: 927 typically relates to issues with the laser or laser-related components. To resolve the issue, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check the laser interlock system: Ensure that all doors and access points are closed and the interlock system is functioning correctly.\n2. Verify laser parameters: Check the laser parameters, such as power, frequency, and pulse width, to ensure they are set correctly.\n3. Inspect the laser optics: Clean or replace the laser optics if necessary. Check for any signs of damage or misalignment.\n4. Check the laser gas mixture: Verify that the laser gas mixture is correct and within the recommended range.\n5. Restart the system: Sometimes, simply restarting the system can resolve the issue.\n6. Check for any error messages or warnings: Review the system logs and error messages to identify any underlying causes of the alarm.\n7. Consult the user manual: Refer to the Tulus Manual software user manual or documentation for specific guidance on resolving Alarm ID: 927.\n8.
