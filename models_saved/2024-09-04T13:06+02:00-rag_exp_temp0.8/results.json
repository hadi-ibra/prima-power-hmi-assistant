Configure the backup settings, including the backup directory and file naming conventions.\n5. Save the backup configuration.\n\n**FPServiceBroker Status Control:**\n\n1. Go to the **Status of FPServiceBroker** section.\n2. Check the current status (RUNNING or STOPPED).\n3. To start the FPServiceBroker service, click the **Start** button (if it's enabled).\n4. To stop the FPServiceBroker service, click the **Stop** button (if it's enabled).\n\n**Additional Features:**\n\n1. To view the status of tasks, go to the **Task status view** tab.\n2. To manage batch programs, go to the **Batch Programs** tab and configure the programs to be executed independently of the interface.\n3. To configure file backups, go to the **File backups** tab and set up the file backup configurations.\n\n**Using the Interface:**\n\n1. Use the numbered arrows and callout boxes to navigate the interface and understand the different features and settings.\n2. Use the **Test** button to test the backup configurations and ensure they work as expected.\n3. Use the **Save** button to save changes to the backup configurations.\n4. Use the **New**, **Delete**, and **Edit** buttons to manage the backup configurations and batch programs.\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up and oversee various backups in the database software and control the FPServiceBroker's status with Start/Stop.", "To set up and oversee various backups in a database software, you can perform backups at regular intervals, with backups named according to the number of the current backup. The current backup number is used as an identifier in addition to the main file name. For example, the FPSuiteMainDB database backups will be named FPSuiteMainDB1, FPSuiteMainDB2, and so on. The last backup file is always saved with the number 1. The number of backup copies to keep is indicated during the backup configuration phase, and the database is not compressed into a .zip file. Daily backups can also be performed, with backups called according to the day of the week. For example, the FPSuiteMainDB database backups will be named FPSuiteMainDB.Monday, FPSuiteMainDB.Tuesday, and so on. The database is compressed into a .zip file. To start the database backup, it is necessary to create a connection to an existing SQL Server instance. The connection ensures that the configured databases are available and that errors in writing names are avoided. To control the FPServiceBroker's status, you can use the Start and Stop buttons. If the service is RUNNING, the Start button is disabled, and the Stop button is enabled. If the service is STOPPED, the Start button is enabled, and the Stop button is disabled."], ["The application that manages Tulus license activation, using computer-specific codes and software information is \"License Management\".", "The License Management application is used to manage Tulus licenses and their activation. It utilizes the computer's serial number, machine identification code, and the software name and version for license activation."], ["According to the context, users can perform the following actions on backup profiles via the 'New', 'Delete', 'Edit' buttons:\n\n1. 'New' button: Create new backup profiles.\n2. 'Delete' button: Remove existing backup profiles.\n3. 'Edit' button: Modify existing backup profiles.\n\nThese profiles seem to be used for configuring database backups. Each profile might specify:\n\n- Location: The directory where the backup files will be stored (e.g., 'Copy to directory' field).\n- Time: The interval at which regular backups are scheduled (e.g., 'Interval in minutes' field) and the time at which daily backups are performed (e.g., 'Time' field).\n- Copy directory: An additional directory where a copy of the backup files will be saved (e.g., 'Daily backup copy directory' field).\n\nThe use of these profiles is likely to manage and customize the database backup process. By creating, modifying, and deleting profiles, users can:\n\n- Schedule regular backups to ensure data is frequently backed up.\n- Set up daily backups to create a secondary copy of the data.\n- Specify different directories for storing backup files, potentially for organization or redundancy purposes.\n- Easily manage multiple databases with distinct backup settings.\n\nOverall, the 'New', 'Delete', and 'Edit' buttons allow users to customize and manage backup profiles to suit their specific database backup needs.", "Users can perform various actions on backup profiles using the 'New', 'Delete', and 'Edit' buttons. The 'New' button likely allows users to create a new backup profile. The 'Delete' button might be used to remove existing backup profiles. The 'Edit' button is probably for modifying the settings of existing backup profiles. Considering the fields for location, time, and copy directory, these profiles could be related to scheduling and managing regular backups. Users can specify the location for these regular backups, set a specific time for the backups, and choose a directory to copy the backup files to."]]}{"summary": {"bleu_result": {"bleu": 0.15290062965845552, "precisions": [0.2828859822790562, 0.1692315305062101, 0.12199416440285743, 0.0935848027011357], "brevity_penalty": 1.0, "length_ratio": 2.252677755437763, "translation_length": 61622, "reference_length": 27355}, "rouge_result": {"rouge1": 0.4448332443929801, "rouge2": 0.3107571711579457, "rougeL": 0.39710664947764274, "rougeLsum": 0.3990922097407299}, "bert_result": {"mean_precision": 0.8788608708977699, "mean_recall": 0.9108874228596687, "mean_f1": 0.8942013911604881}}}
