Look for the 'Backup' or 'Backup Settings' option.\n\n2. **Configuring Interval-Based Backups**: In the Backup Settings, you should find an option to set up interval-based backups. This may be labeled as 'Scheduled Backups' or 'Automatic Backups'. Set the desired interval (e.g., every hour, daily, weekly) and choose the backup type (e.g., full, incremental).\n\n3. **Setting Up Day-of-the-Week Labeled Backups**: In the same Backup Settings section, look for an option to set up day-of-the-week labeled backups. This might be labeled as 'Weekly Backups' or 'Daily Backups'. Choose the specific days of the week and the time you want the backups to occur.\n\n4. **Controlling FPServiceBroker's Status**: To control the FPServiceBroker's status, navigate to the 'Services' or 'System Services' section within the Tulus Manual software. Look for the 'FPServiceBroker' service and click on it. You should see options to 'Start' or 'Stop' the service. Click on the desired action to control the FPServiceBroker's status.\n\n5. **Monitoring Backup Status**: To oversee the backup status, navigate to the 'Backup' or 'Backup History' section within the Tulus Manual software. This section should display a list of completed backups, including the date, time, and status of each backup.\n\nPlease note that the exact steps may vary depending on the version of the Tulus Manual software you are using. If you are unsure about any of these steps, refer to the software's user manual or contact the support team for assistance.", "To set up and oversee various backups in a database software, you can perform backups at regular intervals, with backups named according to the number of the current backup. The current backup number is used as an identifier in addition to the main file name. For example, the FPSuiteMainDB database backups will be named FPSuiteMainDB1, FPSuiteMainDB2, and so on. The last backup file is always saved with the number 1. The number of backup copies to keep is indicated during the backup configuration phase, and the database is not compressed into a .zip file. Daily backups can also be performed, with backups called according to the day of the week. For example, the FPSuiteMainDB database backups will be named FPSuiteMainDB.Monday, FPSuiteMainDB.Tuesday, and so on. The database is compressed into a .zip file. To start the database backup, it is necessary to create a connection to an existing SQL Server instance. The connection ensures that the configured databases are available and that errors in writing names are avoided. To control the FPServiceBroker's status, you can use the Start and Stop buttons. If the service is RUNNING, the Start button is disabled, and the Stop button is enabled. If the service is STOPPED, the Start button is enabled, and the Stop button is disabled."], ["The app that manages Tulus license activation, using comp-specific codes & software info is likely the Prima Power License Manager or a similar tool provided by Prima Power for managing Tulus licenses.", "The License Management application is used to manage Tulus licenses and their activation. It utilizes the computer's serial number, machine identification code, and the software name and version for license activation."], ["The 'New', 'Delete', and 'Edit' buttons for backup profiles in Tulus Manual software likely allow users to manage and customize their backup settings. \n\n- The 'New' button probably enables users to create a new backup profile, specifying the location where the backup will be stored, the time when the backup will occur, and the copy directory where the backup files will be saved.\n- The 'Delete' button likely allows users to remove an existing backup profile, which may be useful if the profile is no longer needed or if the user wants to free up storage space.\n- The 'Edit' button probably permits users to modify an existing backup profile, such as changing the backup location, time, or copy directory.\n\nThe use of these backup profiles is likely to automate and customize the backup process for Tulus Manual software. By creating and managing backup profiles, users can ensure that their data is regularly backed up to a secure location, reducing the risk of data loss in case of system failure or other disasters. The fields for location, time, and copy directory allow users to tailor the backup process to their specific needs, such as backing up data to an external drive or network location at a specific time of day.", "Users can perform various actions on backup profiles using the 'New', 'Delete', and 'Edit' buttons. The 'New' button likely allows users to create a new backup profile. The 'Delete' button might be used to remove existing backup profiles. The 'Edit' button is probably for modifying the settings of existing backup profiles. Considering the fields for location, time, and copy directory, these profiles could be related to scheduling and managing regular backups. Users can specify the location for these regular backups, set a specific time for the backups, and choose a directory to copy the backup files to."]]}{"summary": {"bleu_result": {"bleu": 0.06609927147110183, "precisions": [0.15847598012147984, 0.07437224270999424, 0.04783119795319615, 0.03386110362854549], "brevity_penalty": 1.0, "length_ratio": 3.7736062876987755, "translation_length": 103227, "reference_length": 27355}, "rouge_result": {"rouge1": 0.2826159036668172, "rouge2": 0.15786599739668894, "rougeL": 0.24246252176870364, "rougeLsum": 0.24307601219000852}, "bert_result": {"mean_precision": 0.8494945165514945, "mean_recall": 0.8920953975319862, "mean_f1": 0.8700399363040924}}}
