Here, you can set the interval at which backups are performed, such as every 60 minutes. You can also specify the number of backup copies to keep.\n\n3. **Configure Day-of-the-Week Backups**: In the same section, you may find an option to schedule backups based on the day of the week. This could be labeled as \"Daily Backup\" or \"Weekly Backup.\" Select the days of the week on which you want backups to occur.\n\n4. **Specify Backup File Names**: Ensure that the backup file names are correctly formatted, including the database name and a unique identifier, such as the day of the week (e.g., FPSuiteMainDB.Monday).\n\n5. **Set the Backup Directory**: Specify the directory where the backup files will be stored. This could be a local directory or a network location.\n\n6. **Enable/Disable Backups**: Make sure to enable the backup configuration for each database you want to back up.\n\n7. **Control FPServiceBroker Status**: To control the FPServiceBroker status, navigate to the \"Status of FPServiceBroker\" section. Here, you can start or stop the service using the \"Start\" and \"Stop\" buttons.\n\n8. **Monitor Backup Status**: Regularly check the backup status to ensure that backups are being performed successfully. You can do this by checking the backup logs or monitoring the backup directory.\n\n9. **Test Backup Configuration**: Use the \"Test\" button to test your backup configuration and ensure that backups are being performed correctly.\n\n10. **Save Changes**: After making any changes to the backup configuration, be sure to save your changes to ensure they take effect.\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up and oversee various backups in your database software, including interval-based backups and day-of-the-week labeled backups, and control the FPServiceBroker status.", "To set up and oversee various backups in a database software, you can perform backups at regular intervals, with backups named according to the number of the current backup.
