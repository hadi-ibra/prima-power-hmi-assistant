The last backup file is always saved with the number 1. The number of backup copies to keep is indicated during the backup configuration phase, and the database is not compressed into a .zip file. Daily backups can also be performed, with backups called according to the day of the week. For example, the FPSuiteMainDB database backups will be named FPSuiteMainDB.Monday, FPSuiteMainDB.Tuesday, and so on. The database is compressed into a .zip file. To start the database backup, it is necessary to create a connection to an existing SQL Server instance. The connection ensures that the configured databases are available and that errors in writing names are avoided. To control the FPServiceBroker's status, you can use the Start and Stop buttons. If the service is RUNNING, the Start button is disabled, and the Stop button is enabled. If the service is STOPPED, the Start button is enabled, and the Stop button is disabled."], ["The app that manages Tulus license activation, using company-specific codes and software information, is the License Manager.", "The License Management application is used to manage Tulus licenses and their activation. It utilizes the computer's serial number, machine identification code, and the software name and version for license activation."], ["The 'New', 'Delete', and 'Edit' buttons for backup profiles in Tulus likely allow users to create, delete, and modify existing backup profiles, respectively. \n\nThe 'New' button probably enables users to create a new backup profile by specifying the location where the backup will be saved, the time at which the backup will be performed, and the copy directory where the backup will be stored.\n\nThe 'Delete' button likely allows users to remove an existing backup profile, which would prevent the system from performing the associated backup operation.\n\nThe 'Edit' button probably enables users to modify the settings of an existing backup profile, such as changing the location, time, or copy directory.\n\nThe use of these backup profiles is likely to automate the process of backing up data, such as machine settings, work programs, or other important files, to a specified location at a specified time. This would help ensure that critical data is regularly saved and can be easily recovered in case of a system failure or data loss.", "Users can perform various actions on backup profiles using the 'New', 'Delete', and 'Edit' buttons. The 'New' button likely allows users to create a new backup profile. The 'Delete' button might be used to remove existing backup profiles. The 'Edit' button is probably for modifying the settings of existing backup profiles. Considering the fields for location, time, and copy directory, these profiles could be related to scheduling and managing regular backups. Users can specify the location for these regular backups, set a specific time for the backups, and choose a directory to copy the backup files to."]]}{"summary": {"bleu_result": {"bleu": 0.08805236403223886, "precisions": [0.20148067047261542, 0.0980389567514031, 0.06479498982978268, 0.04696675843923345], "brevity_penalty": 1.0, "length_ratio": 2.804679217693292, "translation_length": 76722, "reference_length": 27355}, "rouge_result": {"rouge1": 0.3277729562782876, "rouge2": 0.18773741484432133, "rougeL": 0.2833790422320816, "rougeLsum": 0.2848240260219953}, "bert_result": {"mean_precision": 0.8636264533400536, "mean_recall": 0.8955218626856803, "mean_f1": 0.8790145990848541}}}
