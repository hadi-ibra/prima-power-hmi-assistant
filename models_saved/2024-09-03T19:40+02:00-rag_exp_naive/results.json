The HMI's functions vary depending on the operating mode: Manual, MDA, and Automatic.\n\n**Manual Mode:**\nIn Manual mode, the HMI allows the user to move all axes of the machine, including auxiliary axes, if any. This mode is likely used for setup, testing, or maintenance purposes.\n\n**MDA Mode:**\nIn MDA (Manufacturing Data Acquisition) mode, the HMI enables the user to run utility programs and create simple movement programs. This mode is likely used for tasks such as calibration, testing, or setup of the machine.\n\n**Automatic Mode:**\nIn Automatic mode, the HMI allows the user to carry out a work table, which can be a single program or a sequence of several programs. This mode is likely used for production runs, where the machine operates autonomously.\n\n**Common HMI Functions:**\nAcross all modes, the HMI provides the following functions:\n\n1. **Monitoring:** The HMI displays the machine's status, including the current mode, program execution, and any errors or alarms.\n2. **Control:** The HMI allows the user to start, stop, and pause the machine, as well as adjust parameters and settings.\n3. **Parameter Setting:** The HMI enables the user to set specific parameters, such as technological data, for the machine's operation.\n4. **Error Handling:** The HMI provides error messages and alerts, allowing the user to diagnose and resolve issues.\n5. **Program Management:** The HMI allows the user to create, edit, and manage programs, including MDA programs and work tables.\n\n**Additional Functions:**\nThe HMI may also provide additional functions, such as:\n\n1. **Utilities:** The HMI offers a range of utility programs for tasks like calibration, testing, and maintenance.\n2. **Settings:** The HMI allows the user to configure machine settings, such as automatic switch-off, dry cycle, and restart behavior.\n3. **Microjoint Settings:** The HMI enables the user to set up microjoint parameters, including area and thickness settings.\n\nOverall, the HMI plays a critical role in the operation of the machine, providing a user-friendly interface for monitoring, controlling, and configuring the machine's functions.", "The HMI (user interface) in the machine plays a crucial role in its operation.
