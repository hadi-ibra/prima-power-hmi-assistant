How does the hierarchical structure in the navigation pane help with organizing and accessing subitems in the selected folder?,"The hierarchical structure in the navigation pane helps with organizing and accessing subitems in the selected folder by allowing users to categorize and nest related items within each other. This structure enables users to:

1. Group related items together: By creating folders and subfolders, users can group related items together, making it easier to find and access specific items.
2. Drill down to specific items: The hierarchical structure allows users to drill down to specific items by expanding folders and subfolders, making it easier to navigate to the desired item.
3. Visualize relationships between items: The hierarchical structure provides a visual representation of the relationships between items, making it easier for users to understand how different items are related to each other.
4. Reduce clutter: By nesting items within each other, the hierarchical structure helps to reduce clutter in the navigation pane, making it easier for users to focus on the items they need to access.

In the context of the Machine Parameter Editor, the hierarchical structure in the navigation pane helps users to organize and access subitems in the selected folder (e.g., PalStation1500) by grouping related parameters together (e.g., Standard, Parameters, Fluid, etc.) and allowing users to drill down to specific parameters (e.g., Tia 13.1, 17.4, PSA 1530, etc.).","['On the top left corner there is a menu bar with options like File Create Problemize Copy Tool Comparison Tool Setting Configuration Tool and Storage Tool. 2.
