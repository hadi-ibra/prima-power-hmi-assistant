Below that there is a yellow section labeled Confirm pallets with a number input field and information about a nozzle from ST 1.0 to ST 2.5. 5. In the central area there are several buttons labeled with different sizes or types like ST 1.0 ST 1.5 DT 2.5 etc. arranged in two rows. These may represent slots or stations for parts or tools.', 'On the left side of the image there is a vertical toolbar with icons that likely represent different functions or tools. One of these icons highlighted by a red square seems to be selected or activated. This icon depicts a clipboard with a checkmark which could suggest a taskrelated function such as a todo list or a checklist. An arrow points from the selected toolbar icon to a larger more detailed panel on the right side of the image. This panel contains several buttons arranged in rows. The buttons are labeled with letters X Y Z Q and B which might correspond to different commands or settings perhaps in a technical or industrial context such as machinery control or 3D modeling software. The Q button is outlined in red indicating it is related to the selected toolbar icon. Below the rows of letterlabeled buttons there are larger buttons with the following labels ZERO HOME CALSENS and SWAP. These could be commands for resetting setting a home position calibrating sensors and swapping settings or tools. At the bottom there is a Close button which likely closes the panel or exits the settings menu. Overall the image seems to be a graphical representation of a software interface for controlling a machine or system with an emphasis on the selection and activation of a particular function related to the Q setting or tool. Each button on the top of the control panel identifies an axis of the machine\n X Xaxis horizontal axis\n Y Yaxis vertical axis\n Z heights axis\n Q collimator axis if present\n B focal axis\nClicking on one of the letters that identify the axes the relevant button lights up and allows the\noperator to move the selected axis along the desired direction using the Jog  and Jog  buttons\non the console. 8.2 ZERO AXES procedure\nThis operation must be carried out every time the operator turns on the machine and before\nrunning any cutting program. The ZERO AXIS procedure ensures that regardless of the last machine status the three main\naxes are repositioned in their original coordinates. The procedure can only be performed in MDA mode. To carry out the axis reset operation activate the corresponding button on the control panel and\nthen to use the machine Start button to start the program. The image displays a graphical user interface with a blue background and several buttons arranged in two rows. Each button appears to be a digital representation of a control panel possibly for a machine or a software application. In the top row there are four buttons labeled X Y Z and B respectively. These could represent controls for different axes or settings in a system that operates in a multidimensional space such as a CNC machine robot or 3D software interface. In the second row there are four buttons with the labels ZERO HOME CALSENS and SWAP. The ZERO button is highlighted with a red border indicating that it might be currently selected or active. The ZERO button could be used to reset or define the zero point for the systems coordinates. HOME could be used to return the system to a predefined home position. CALSENS might be short for calibrate sensors or something similar suggesting a function to calibrate the systems sensors. SWAP could allow the user to switch or swap between different modes settings or tools. At the bottom of the interface there is a larger button labeled Close which would typically be used to exit the interface or close the window. Overall the interface seems to be designed for controlling a technical device or system that requires precise adjustments and settings. The machine will start operating and move the axes in space until the point of origin is reached. Once the operation has been carried out the machine will stop and will therefore be ready for the\nexecution of a cutting program. 8.3 HOME procedure\nThe HOME procedure is used to return the machine to a specific reference position which is\nalways the same. The procedure can only be performed in MDA mode. It is not mandatory to perform this procedure before running a cutting program. To carry out the HOME operation activate the corresponding button on the control panel and then\nuse the machine Start button to start the program. The image shows a graphical user interface with a blue background and a collection of button elements arranged in two rows. In the top row there are four buttons labeled X Y Z and B they are designed with white backgrounds and black text. The bottom row consists of four buttons as well with the second button from the left labeled HOME highlighted with a red outline signifying its importance or selection. The other buttons in the bottom row are labeled ZERO CALSENS and SWAP also with white backgrounds and black text. Below these rows of buttons there is a larger button centered horizontally with the label Close on it suggesting a function to exit or close the interface. Overall the interface seems to be designed for some sort of machine control or settings panel where each button likely corresponds to a specific function or command. 8.4 CALSENS procedure\nThis procedure is used to calibrate the capacitive sensor. This operation must be performed whenever the operator turns on the machine or if the nozzle is\nreplaced. It is also advisable to carry out this procedure whenever the sensor does not work properly. The procedure can only be performed in MDA mode. To carry out the CALSENS operation first make sure that the nozzle is clean and well tightened. Activate the related button on the control panel and then use the machine Start button to start\nexecuting the program.']","The labels include ST 1.0, ST 1.5, and DT 2.5.","The text describes a user interface with tool icons for actions like moving items to the top, moving them up, removing them, and adding new items.

Each button on the top of the control panel identifies an axis of the machine\n X Xaxis horizontal axis\n Y Yaxis vertical axis\n Z heights axis\n Q collimator axis if present\n B focal axis\nClicking on one of the letters that identify the axes the relevant button lights up and allows the\noperator to move the selected axis along the desired direction using the Jog  and Jog  buttons\non the console. 8.2 ZERO AXES procedure\nThis operation must be carried out every time the operator turns on the machine and before\nrunning any cutting program. The ZERO AXIS procedure ensures that regardless of the last machine status the three main\naxes are repositioned in their original coordinates. The procedure can only be performed in MDA mode. To carry out the axis reset operation activate the corresponding button on the control panel and\nthen to use the machine Start button to start the program. The image displays a graphical user interface with a blue background and several buttons arranged in two rows. Each button appears to be a digital representation of a control panel possibly for a machine or a software application. In the top row there are four buttons labeled X Y Z and B respectively. These could represent controls for different axes or settings in a system that operates in a multidimensional space such as a CNC machine robot or 3D software interface. In the second row there are four buttons with the labels ZERO HOME CALSENS and SWAP. The ZERO button is highlighted with a red border indicating that it might be currently selected or active. The ZERO button could be used to reset or define the zero point for the systems coordinates. HOME could be used to return the system to a predefined home position. CALSENS might be short for calibrate sensors or something similar suggesting a function to calibrate the systems sensors. SWAP could allow the user to switch or swap between different modes settings or tools. At the bottom of the interface there is a larger button labeled Close which would typically be used to exit the interface or close the window. Overall the interface seems to be designed for controlling a technical device or system that requires precise adjustments and settings. The machine will start operating and move the axes in space until the point of origin is reached. Once the operation has been carried out the machine will stop and will therefore be ready for the\nexecution of a cutting program. 8.3 HOME procedure\nThe HOME procedure is used to return the machine to a specific reference position which is\nalways the same. The procedure can only be performed in MDA mode. It is not mandatory to perform this procedure before running a cutting program. To carry out the HOME operation activate the corresponding button on the control panel and then\nuse the machine Start button to start the program. The image shows a graphical user interface with a blue background and a collection of button elements arranged in two rows. In the top row there are four buttons labeled X Y Z and B they are designed with white backgrounds and black text. The bottom row consists of four buttons as well with the second button from the left labeled HOME highlighted with a red outline signifying its importance or selection. The other buttons in the bottom row are labeled ZERO CALSENS and SWAP also with white backgrounds and black text. Below these rows of buttons there is a larger button centered horizontally with the label Close on it suggesting a function to exit or close the interface. Overall the interface seems to be designed for some sort of machine control or settings panel where each button likely corresponds to a specific function or command. 8.4 CALSENS procedure\nThis procedure is used to calibrate the capacitive sensor. This operation must be performed whenever the operator turns on the machine or if the nozzle is\nreplaced. It is also advisable to carry out this procedure whenever the sensor does not work properly. The procedure can only be performed in MDA mode. To carry out the CALSENS operation first make sure that the nozzle is clean and well tightened. Activate the related button on the control panel and then use the machine Start button to start\nexecuting the program.']",These fields are likely used to enter or display positional information and orientation for the equipment being controlled.,"The interface is divided into multiple sections with various controls and information panels.
