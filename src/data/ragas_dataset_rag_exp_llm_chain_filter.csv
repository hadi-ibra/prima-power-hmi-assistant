In the top row there are four buttons labeled X Y Z and B from left to right. The labels suggest these buttons may correspond to controls or settings for different axes or parameters possibly in a machine control or software interface. In the second row there are also four buttons. From left to right the labels read ZERO HOME CALSENS and SWAP. The CALSENS button is surrounded by a red outline indicating it may be currently selected or highlighted for some reason. Below the two rows of buttons there is a larger rectangular button labeled Close. This button is likely used to exit or close the interface window. Overall the interface appears to be some sort of control panel possibly for a machine or software application that requires calibration or adjustment of spatial coordinates or settings. The emphasis on CALSENS suggests it could be related to calibration sensitivity or a similar function. The machine will position the Zaxis in safety and move the X and Y axes near to the brush for\ncleaning. When the cleaning is completed the head will lower itself until it touches the sheet and\nsubsequently it will lift itself very slowly reading the counts necessary for calibrating the sensor. Once the calibration phase is completed the head will return to the starting position. 8.5 SWAP procedure\nThis procedure is used to manually change the pallet when a particular need arises for example\nfor stopping current production and starting a new machining process. The procedure can only be performed in MDA mode. To carry out the SWAP operation it is necessary to activate the relative button on the control panel\nand then use the machine Start button to start the program execution. The image shows a graphical user interface with a series of buttons arranged in two rows on a blue background. The top row contains four buttons labeled from left to right X Y Z B. These buttons have a plain design with a white background and black text. The second row consists of four buttons as well with the first three having the same design as the top row and labeled ZERO HOME CALSENS. The fourth button in this row is outlined with a red rectangle suggesting it is highlighted or selected and is labeled SWAP. This button has a slightly different design with a gray background indicating it might be currently active or the focus of the interaction. Below these two rows of buttons is a larger rectangular button labeled Close which likely serves to close the interface or cancel the operation. The interface appears to be a control panel possibly for a machine or software application where each button may correspond to a command or function. The SWAP buttons distinct appearance suggests it might perform a special or important action within the context of this interface. The machine will command the pallet change in order to exchange the pallet in the work area with\nthe pallet in the loading area.', 'On the left side of the image there is a vertical toolbar with icons that likely represent different functions or tools. One of these icons highlighted by a red square seems to be selected or activated.

An arrow points from the selected toolbar icon to a larger more detailed panel on the right side of the image. This panel contains several buttons arranged in rows. The buttons are labeled with letters X Y Z Q and B which might correspond to different commands or settings perhaps in a technical or industrial context such as machinery control or 3D modeling software. The Q button is outlined in red indicating it is related to the selected toolbar icon. Below the rows of letterlabeled buttons there are larger buttons with the following labels ZERO HOME CALSENS and SWAP. These could be commands for resetting setting a home position calibrating sensors and swapping settings or tools. At the bottom there is a Close button which likely closes the panel or exits the settings menu.

The ZERO AXIS procedure ensures that regardless of the last machine status the three main\naxes are repositioned in their original coordinates. The procedure can only be performed in MDA mode. To carry out the axis reset operation activate the corresponding button on the control panel and\nthen to use the machine Start button to start the program. The image displays a graphical user interface with a blue background and several buttons arranged in two rows. Each button appears to be a digital representation of a control panel possibly for a machine or a software application. In the top row there are four buttons labeled X Y Z and B respectively. These could represent controls for different axes or settings in a system that operates in a multidimensional space such as a CNC machine robot or 3D software interface. In the second row there are four buttons with the labels ZERO HOME CALSENS and SWAP. The ZERO button is highlighted with a red border indicating that it might be currently selected or active. The ZERO button could be used to reset or define the zero point for the systems coordinates. HOME could be used to return the system to a predefined home position. CALSENS might be short for calibrate sensors or something similar suggesting a function to calibrate the systems sensors. SWAP could allow the user to switch or swap between different modes settings or tools. At the bottom of the interface there is a larger button labeled Close which would typically be used to exit the interface or close the window. Overall the interface seems to be designed for controlling a technical device or system that requires precise adjustments and settings. The machine will start operating and move the axes in space until the point of origin is reached. Once the operation has been carried out the machine will stop and will therefore be ready for the\nexecution of a cutting program. 8.3 HOME procedure\nThe HOME procedure is used to return the machine to a specific reference position which is\nalways the same. The procedure can only be performed in MDA mode. It is not mandatory to perform this procedure before running a cutting program. To carry out the HOME operation activate the corresponding button on the control panel and then\nuse the machine Start button to start the program. The image shows a graphical user interface with a blue background and a collection of button elements arranged in two rows. In the top row there are four buttons labeled X Y Z and B they are designed with white backgrounds and black text. The bottom row consists of four buttons as well with the second button from the left labeled HOME highlighted with a red outline signifying its importance or selection. The other buttons in the bottom row are labeled ZERO CALSENS and SWAP also with white backgrounds and black text. Below these rows of buttons there is a larger button centered horizontally with the label Close on it suggesting a function to exit or close the interface. Overall the interface seems to be designed for some sort of machine control or settings panel where each button likely corresponds to a specific function or command. 8.4 CALSENS procedure\nThis procedure is used to calibrate the capacitive sensor. This operation must be performed whenever the operator turns on the machine or if the nozzle is\nreplaced. It is also advisable to carry out this procedure whenever the sensor does not work properly. The procedure can only be performed in MDA mode. To carry out the CALSENS operation first make sure that the nozzle is clean and well tightened. Activate the related button on the control panel and then use the machine Start button to start\nexecuting the program.']",Repeat the MIF procedure of the PA.,An error occurred during the Zero procedure due to the wrong position of the drag proximity inside the machine.
