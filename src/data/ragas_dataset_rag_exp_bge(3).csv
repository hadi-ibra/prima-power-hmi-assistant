The interface warns the operator if the program to be executed requires a nozzle that differs from\nthe one assembled. The Nozzle change section is present only if the machine is equipped with an automatic nozzle\nchange. The automatic nozzle change system allows for assembly and disassembly of the nozzles. The\nnozzles are contained in the nozzle magazine and are replaced automatically by the operator due\nto excessive wear or because the cutting program requires a different nozzle to that currently\ninstalled. The user interface which can only be controlled in MDA mode shows a list of all the nozzles\ncurrently present in the magazine. Each rectangle in the list defines the information relating to the\nnozzle in the station the type of nozzle the diameter the degree of wear and the position within\nthe magazine. The degree of wear of the nozzle is shown on the interface with a change in the colour of the wear\nbar for each nozzle. As wear increases the colour of the bar will become more and more red. When the wear threshold exceeds the permitted threshold by 150 the nozzle must be replaced. By using the RESET button on the console both the meters that measure the degree of wear and\nthe status of the nozzle can be reset.

These controls indicate that the interface could be for a machine or piece of equipment that operates in either manual or automatic modes and requires start/stop commands possibly for some sort of manufacturing laboratory or technical process. The design is utilitarian focusing on clear labels and functionality over aesthetic design. 2.5.1 List of SidePanel buttons and functions\nSwitching on the laser source\nThe image shows a simple graphic symbol for a laser. It consists of a central circle with numerous rays emanating outwards representing the light emitted from a laser source. On the left side there is a straight line that connects to the center of the circle possibly representing the laser beam itself. Below this graphic there is a label that reads LASER indicating that the symbol is identifying the presence or use of a laser device or laser light. The overall design is monochromatic and contained within a square border. Switches on the laser source. space\nBypass overtravel\nThe image shows a simple diagram consisting of a horizontal line with a perpendicular tick mark near the left end and an arrow pointing to the right originating from the tick mark. Below this diagram there is a word OVERTRAVEL in all caps. This diagram appears to be a schematic symbol or an indicator for a concept or mechanism related to overtravel which generally refers to the idea of something moving beyond its intended stopping point or range of motion. This could be related to mechanical engineering electronics or another technical field where precise movements are necessary and overtravel must be monitored or prevented. In the event of a locking error once MANUAL mode has been selected this\nallows you to remove the lock. Example In the event of an electrical limit\nswitch intervention you will no longer be able to give motor power or move the\naxis unless this function is selected first once the safety conditions have been\nrestored the button MUST be disabled. SPACE\nJog\nThe image shows two rectangular buttons side by side presumably part of a user interface. The left button has a horizontal line symbol often used to represent the concept of back or subtract and is labeled BACK underneath the symbol. The right button features a cross or plus symbol commonly associated with forward or add and is labeled FORWARD below the symbol. The overall design is simple and monochromatic with the symbols and text in black on a light gray background which suggests a minimalistic approach to interface design. The buttons likely represent navigation controls with the left button used to go to a previous screen or step and the right button to advance to the next screen or step. The Jog buttons allow you to move the selected axis X Y Z in the\nrequired direction. The axis will then move positively or negatively with respect to its\norigin. space\nOperating mode\nThe image shows a set of three rectangular icons each with a different background color symbol and text label. 1.', 'laser. 2 Play/Stop Button Start/stop a task list. It is used to browse through the different views of the\n3 Main menu\ninterface by clicking on the respective buttons. It manages adding/changing/removing operations of a\n4 Tool bar\nwork program in the task list. It contains the list of current production orders and\n5 Task list notifications if any regarding situations that have to be\nmanaged manually or automatically. 6 Current tab It shows different views depending on the selected tab. Shows the current line of the cutting program and takes\n7 Current block\nyou into the restart panel. It contains additional status information such as the time\n8 Footer bar\nand alarm notifications if any. 2.3 Operating mode\nThe HMI is structured in a customised single level based on the machines operating mode\n Manual\n MDA\n Automatic\nSome functions of the interface may be disabled according to the operating mode. Only the\nfunctions that the machine can perform in the currently active mode are enabled. MANUAL MODE\nManual mode allows to move all the axes of the machine including the auxiliary axes if any. The image appears to be a screenshot of a user interface from a software application possibly for managing industrial equipment or processes given the references to a laser tool.']","The controls for the laser source allow the user to switch the laser source on, as indicated by the graphic symbol of a laser with a label that reads 'LASER'.",['It resembles a file management or project management view although the specific details and text within the window are not clear enough to discern the exact nature of the software. There are icons and tabs at the top that suggest functionalities such as saving opening files or possibly other projectrelated actions. On the right side theres a collection of graphical icons with labels underneath them likely representing controls or functions for a specific device or application. The icons are grouped into three main sections\n\n1. The top section includes icons that seem to represent functions like LASER OVERTRAVEL LIGHT and directional controls such as BACK and FORWARD. 2. The middle section has a START and STOP button which are typically used to begin or cease operations. 3.
