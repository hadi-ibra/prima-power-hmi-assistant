Diagram Interpretation,The system can be represented as follows: The image appears to be a simple schematic or layout diagram possibly of a building or station. In the center of the image there is a large rectangular structure labeled PA with Tower suggesting that this is a public address system with a tower which might be a central feature of the layout. Flanking the central structure on both sides are smaller rectangular structures. The one on the left is labeled Additional station side and the one on the right is labeled Machine side indicating that these areas might serve different functions or contain different equipment. Doubleheaded arrows between the central structure and the flanking structures suggest movement or interaction between these areas.
