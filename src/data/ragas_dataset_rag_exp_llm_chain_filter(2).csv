MDA mode \nSYMBOL FUNCTION DESCRIPTION\nIt appears that youve shared an icon rather than a standard image. The icon features a blue cross with a lighter blue outline and shadow giving it a threedimensional effect. Adjacent to the cross on its left side is a series of four characters three asterisks and a plus sign. These characters are also in blue and are aligned horizontally. The icon likely represents some sort of medical or healthrelated service possibly a feature to add health records or data given the common association of the cross symbol with healthcare. The icon has a simple clean design typical of user interface elements intended for easy recognition. It cleans the editor by deleting the commands present if\nNew MDA\nany. Open MDA It opens the folder containing the saved MDA programs. Save MDA It saves the MDA program. Add command It adds a command to the MDA program. Youve sent an emoji that appears to represent a pixelated red X mark over a blue rectangular box with white text that seems to be pixelated as well making it unreadable. The red X typically signifies an error cancellation or a negative response and it is often used in graphical user interfaces to close windows or interrupt operations. The pixelated nature of the image suggests it might be referencing older computer graphics or a style that is intentionally retro. Delete command It deletes the command selected by the MDA program. Copy It copies the selected command. Paste It pastes the previously copied command. Comment It comments the selected command. Delete It cancels the last operation performed. Redo It performs the previously cancelled operation. Move upwards It moves the selected command upwards.', 'The GUI features several tabs at the top suggesting different functionalities or sections which include PALLETS TIP CHANGER OPCNOZZLE CHECK UTILITIES and SETTINGS.
